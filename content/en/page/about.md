My best technical skills are in data science with python (Analysis and Language Processing) and ruby on rails web development.

I hold a degree in computer science from UFRGS, I’d worked as a data scientist at Operation Serenata de Amor, and was responsible for developing models that identify database anomalies and data scraping tools and Natural Programming Language. I am also an active mentor of initiatives that promote gender equality in technology such as Rails and Django Girls.

Besides that, I’ve graduated in Computer Science in February of 2017, and my final thesis was about Natural Language Processing, my CS beloved area.
