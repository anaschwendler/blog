      <description>It’s quarantine time, and we might be tired of staying at home, not going out to live our lives. But we can turn it into something productive that might help other developers in the future. Since we have this free time, it would be awesome to give back (or just to start giving back) to tools that we appreciate and are free.
There are a lot of blog posts that already cover on how to contribute to open source, so I’ll not rewrite what they say.</description>

      <description>And how we did that in Tourlane
Now in Tourlane we are switching our deployment system to use GitHub Actions. So, in this post, we are sharing our experience with the tool so far, and how we are migrating our projects, little by little to the tool.
What is CI/CD? Martin Fowler, one of the original authors of the Agile Manifesto, describes them like this in this book:
 Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day.</description>
