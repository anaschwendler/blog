      <description>It’s quarantine time, and we might be tired of staying at home, not going out to live our lives. But we can turn it into something productive that might help other developers in the future. Since we have this free time, it would be awesome to give back (or just to start giving back) to tools that we appreciate and are free.
There are a lot of blog posts that already cover on how to contribute to open source, so I’ll not rewrite what they say.</description>

      <description>Did you have a good idea for a nice Django plugin? Don’t know how to set up tests for it without creating a whole Django app for your project? Here is the solution for you. This article is written after a pull request for Django Public Admin, using django-stdimage as a base.
Django Public Admin is a plugin that makes a public and read-only version of the Django Admin. It uses Poetry to manage packages and dependencies, pytest to run tests in addition to pytest-django.</description>

      <description>My best technical skills are in data science with python (Analysis and Language Processing) and ruby on rails web development.
I hold a degree in computer science from UFRGS, I’d worked as a data scientist at Operation Serenata de Amor, and was responsible for developing models that identify database anomalies and data scraping tools and Natural Programming Language. I am also an active mentor of initiatives that promote gender equality in technology such as Rails and Django Girls.</description>
